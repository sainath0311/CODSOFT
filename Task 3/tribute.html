        <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Ratan Naval Tata, a name synonymous with excellence, philanthropy, and visionary
        leadership, was an industrialist who shaped modern India. Born on December 28, 1937,
        he led the Tata Group, one of India's largest conglomerates, for over two decades.
        His journey was marked by transformative business decisions, an unyielding commitment
        to ethics, and profound contributions to society. His passing on October 9, 2024,
        leaves an irreplaceable void in the world of industry and philanthropy.</p>

      <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
      <p>Born into the illustrious Tata family, Ratan Tata was raised by his grandmother after
        his parents separated. Despite a privileged upbringing, he displayed humility and a
        strong work ethic. After completing his schooling in Mumbai, he pursued a degree
        in architecture from Cornell University and later attended the Advanced
        Management Program at Harvard Business School. These experiences shaped his
        global outlook and innovative thinking.</p>

      <h2>Achievements and Leadership</h2>
      <p>Ratan Tata took over as Chairman of Tata Sons in 1991, during a period of
        economic liberalization in India. Under his leadership, the Tata Group expanded
        its global footprint, acquiring marquee brands such as Jaguar Land Rover, Tetley, and
        Corus Steel. These bold moves placed Indian industry on the global map.</p>
      <p>He also championed innovation with projects like the Tata Nano, aimed at creating
        an affordable car for Indian families. Under his stewardship, Tata Consultancy
        Services (TCS) became a global leader in IT services, and Tata Motors introduced
        revolutionary vehicles in both commercial and passenger segments.</p>

      <h2>Awards and Recognition</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><span>Padma Bhushan (2000) and Padma Vibhushan (2008),</span>
            two of India’s highest civilian awards.</li>
          <li>Honorary degrees from prestigious universities, including
            <span>Cambridge and Cornell.</span></li>
          <li><span>Recognition by the Queen of England</span>
            with the honorary title of
            <span>Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE)</span>
            or his contributions to strengthening India-UK relations.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Philanthropy and Legacy</h2>
      <p>Beyond business, Ratan Tata was deeply committed to philanthropy. As Chairman
        of Tata Trusts, he steered initiatives in healthcare, education, and rural
        development. Projects like the Tata Medical Center in Kolkata and water purification
        systems for rural areas showcased his desire to uplift marginalized communities.</p>
      <p>He believed in innovation for societal benefit, supporting startups in areas like AI,
        healthcare, and clean energy. His legacy is not just about building a business
        empire but creating a better world.</p>
      
      <h2>A Personal Tribute</h2>
      <p>Ratan Tata was more than a business leader; he was a guiding light for millions.
        His humility, vision, and ability to inspire others made him a revered figure. He once
        said, "I don’t believe in taking the right decisions. I take decisions and make the
        right." This philosophy resonates deeply with aspiring entrepreneurs and leaders worldwide.</p>
      <p>In an era where corporate ethics are often questioned, Ratan Tata stood as a
        paragon of integrity. He reminded us that success is meaningful only when it
        contributes to the greater good.</p>
      <p>As we bid farewell to this extraordinary individual, we celebrate his life
        his contributions, and the indelible mark he has left on the world. May his legacy
        continue to inspire generations to come.</p>
      <p><span>Rest in peace, Sir. You will forever remain a beacon of hope, courage, and innovation.</span></p>
